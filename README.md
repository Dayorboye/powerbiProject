# Power BI Project

  In the business world, Power BI is an essential tool for generating reports from datasets
  and provides a multi-view perspective. Thus, it provides deep insights across multiple pages.
  Furthermore, each page can be designed with a variety of visual elements, giving the creator 
  complete creative freedom. The project report for this project is created by combining data 
  collected from different data warehouse sources in order to generate a responsive report.
